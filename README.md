- 👋 Hi, I’m @krishicagopalakrishnan
- 👀 I’m interested in everything data always looking for new ways to extract knowledge from raw information. I thrive on the challenge of turning data into actionable insights and love exploring the hidden stories within datasets.

While I'm open to data science and engineering roles anywhere, my journey started in my undergraduate studies, where I had the opportunity to work on several hands-on projects. 
These experiences strengthened my technical skills but have also deepened my understanding and increased curiosity of the real-world impact data can have on businesses and industries
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Multi Modal Machine Learning and diving into the depths of LLM's
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects :)
